Lessons and exercises for STEMinist Python Workshop.

This 10-hour Introduction to Python for Data Science course was developed for UC Berkeley [STEMinist](http://calnerds.berkeley.edu/programs/steminist), a techno-sandwich training program designed to provide technical training and mentorship for UC Berkeley STEM female low-income and/or underrepresented minority undergraduate and graduate students.  

The STEMinist Python Workshop will be taught for the first time in Spring 2021*. This workshop is built on the programming and statistical foundations taught in its sister [STEMinist R Workshop](https://github.com/ecalfee/STEMinist_R). 
* First cohort will be taught via Zoom using a shorter (4-hr) course curriculum.

## Using these course materials
Structure:
  - Lessons will be coded in python and markdown via Jupyter notebook or Python scripts. Please note in an effort to move to a more inclusive learning environment, all material will be available in two formats, 1) interactive Jupyter notebooks 2) pdf instructions and py scripts. 
  - Each lesson will include sections with **Examples** and **Exercises**. Students are encouraged, to work in groups for longer exercise assignments. 
  - Homework Problems (Additional material that students can access at the end of each day.) 
  
Solutions to all of the material will be released at the end of the workshop.
We encourge all of the students to join Cal NERDS STEMinist Slack channel. Instructors should share link to join in registration form. This is a forum where students from different cohorts, with different levels of expertise can ask and answer questions about the workshop and beyond, or share news and events.
