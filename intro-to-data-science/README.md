# STEMinist Python Workshop


Lessons and exercises for STEMinist Python Workshop.


This 6-hour Introduction to Python for Data Science course was developed for UC Berkeley [STEMinist](http://calnerds.berkeley.edu/programs/steminist), a techno-sandwich training program designed to provide technical training and mentorship for UC Berkeley STEM female low-income and/or underrepresented minority undergraduate and graduate students.  

The STEMinist Python Workshop will be taught for the first time in Spring 2021*. This workshop is built on the programming and statistical foundations taught in its sister [STEMinist R Workshop](https://github.com/ecalfee/STEMinist_R). In addition to covering the core basics, it also included a data justice module focused on mass incarceration. This unit is part of Victoria Robinson's Ethnic Studies course [A Comparative Survey of Racial and Ethnic Groups in the U.S.](https://github.com/ds-modules/ES-21AC-SP19) Our goal is to provide students with an alternative framework to thinking critically about data, and at the same time empower them to bring their subject-area expertise to data driven solution. 

* First cohort will be taught via Zoom

## Using these course materials

This course is designed as 2-day introduction to Python and concepts of data science. 
  - Day one will introduce data types, data structures, and loops in Python. 
  - Day two will focus on concepts in data data science including basic data manipulation, data visualization, and interpretation of results. Some of the packages used include pandas and matplotlib. 
  

Structure:
  - Lessons will be coded in python and markdown via Jupyter notebook or Python scripts. Please note in an effort to move to a more inclusive learning environment, all material will be available in two formats, 1) interactive Jupyter notebooks 2) pdf instructions and py scripts. 
  - Each lesson will include sections with **Examples** and **Exercises**. Students are encouraged, to work in groups for longer exercise assignments. 
  - Homework Problems (Additional material that students can access at the end of each day.) 
  
Solutions to all of the material will be released at the end of the workshop.
We encourge all of the students to join Cal NERDS Computer Programming Initiative Slack channel. Instructors should share link to join in registration form. This is a forum where students from different cohorts, with different levels of expertise can ask and answer questions about the workshop and beyond, or share news and events. 

__Add notes on live-code and sharing scripts on Slack, homework assignments and extra problems, additional resources, role of TAs, how to monitor questions etc__

__Add note about who this workshop is for, levels of difficulty, and additional resources for those interested in Data Science, hints for Homework/extra practice problems__
